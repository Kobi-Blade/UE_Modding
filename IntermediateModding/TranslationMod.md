# Translation Mods  
This guide covers the steps of translating the game's default language (`.locres`) into any other language. 

> [!NOTE]  
> This guide assumes you're familiar with FModel (exporting) and UnrealPak/repak (for packaging).

## Preparation
For this example, I will be translating a game called [Trepang2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1164940/Trepang2/) from English to Polish using AI.


### Locres Editor

Before we begin, we will be using this `.locres` editor:<br>
[UnrealLocresEditor](https://github.com/Snoozeds/UnrealLocresEditor) by [Snoozeds](https://github.com/Snoozeds).

Download the [release version](https://github.com/Snoozeds/UnrealLocresEditor/releases) and extract the zip file (doesn't matter where).

### Locres File
Using [FModel](https://fmodel.app/), locate the `.locres` file you want to translate and export as raw data as shown below.

> [!TIP]  
> Localization files are usually located in `/Content/Localization/...` and always inside `.pak` regardless of whether the game is IoStore or not.

## Locres to CSV
- Open `UnrealLocresEditor.Desktop.exe`
- File -> Open locres
- Select the exported `.locres` file and click Load

If everything is correct, the localization file will be fully loaded into the editor as shown below.

Next, export it into a `.csv` file by File -> Save As...

Then, open it with Excel.

## Translating
The `.csv` contains 3 columns:
- `key`: the unique identifier (**don't change**).
- `source`: the source text (English).
- `target`: the translated text.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you know the language you're translating to - you can skip this part and translate at your own pace within the Excel sheet.<br>
> Once you're done, continue from [Creating new locres](#creating-new-locres).

For this example, I will be translating a game called [Trepang2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1164940/Trepang2/) from English to Polish using AI.

> [!NOTE]  
> Alternatively, you can use [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/) or other methods, but this is just an example! <br>
> You can use AI for bulk translation and then manually double-check.

### Using AI for translating
As an example, you can bulk translate large amounts of localization files using AI, which both **ClaudeAI** and **OpenAI** are _great_ for these tasks.

Once translated, simply copy the results into the `.csv` and save.

## Creating new `.locres`
Once translated, we can create an updated `.locres` file using the locres editor.

- Open the LocresEditor
- Load the **default** locres by going to File -> Open locres.
- Open the translated spreadsheet by going to File -> Open Spreadsheet.

If everything was done correctly, you should see the original text and the translated text.

Next, export the locres:
- File -> Export locres

## Packaging
Create the mod folder to match the game's original folder structure.

For example, the localization used for this example was located in:<br>
`/Content/Localization/UI_Menus/en`

Meaning the mod folder should follow this structure:<br>
`/<MOD_NAME>_P/<GAME>/Content/Localization/UI_Menus/en`

As shown below:

If you're using unrealpak:
- Drag the mod folder (`<MOD_NAME>_P`) onto the packaging script.
- A new `.pak` file will be created.
- Copy the `.pak` file into the game's Paks folder.

For more information about how to package your mod, view [Cooking Content guide](/IntermediateModding/CookingContent.md).<br>
(don't forget to name your mod with `_P` in its name)
